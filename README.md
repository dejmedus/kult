## Hello Agent üïµÔ∏è

#### The Agency has received reports that followers of the clandestine secret society: Kult av Bl√•haj, will soon attempt to enslave humanity with an airborne toxin meant to control minds.

#### It's up to you to infiltrate this nefarious group, learn the truth, and save humanity.

Kult is a micro text adventure created for the Major League Hacking Agent:Hacker 2 Hackathon.
It was built with Python (3.10.3) and the curses module. It runs in the terminal window.

### Setup

Currently, Kult has only been tested on MacOS. It should run fine on Linux. 

Windows will likely require some extra steps and there may be style and color differences. 

This [article](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/curses-windows-python) recommends installing the [windows-curses package](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/).

2. Clone your-github-username/kult
3. cd into the directory where you will store the game files
4. Paste clone path into your terminal
5. ```cd kult```
6. ```python3 main.py```
7. Enjoy!

### Resources that helped me create Kult
I was inspired to create a CLI game by the fantastic [command line murder mystery.](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery)

These two StackOverflow questions & answers pointed me towards the curses package. The options menu is adapted from the second.
